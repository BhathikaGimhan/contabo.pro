                <p><b>A School that Reflects Kandy's Unique Culture is Born</b></p>
                <p>Trinity College is firmly rooted in the pluralistic culture and atmosphere that is Kandy, the last holdout of the country's ancient kingdoms. And it is this uniqueness that sets the College apart from the many other Private Schools founded by Christian Missionaries in the late 19th century.</p>
                <p>As Prof Gananath Obesekere, the renowned academic notes in his book " The Doomed King, " though the mountain kingdom may have been a citadel for the Sinhala monarchs it boasted a great cosmopolitan culture. </p>
                <p>Fr. Joseph Vaas, the first saint of the Catholic Church in Sri Lanka was one of many who found refuge in Kandy. Then, there were the Arab traders who made this Kingdom their home, to conduct their business with the people of Kandy. as did the many European and East Asian soldiers who, as Robert Knox notes, spent their captivity, living amongst the Kandyans.</p>
                <p>The goal for the Anglican Missionaries who created and helmed Trinity for the first fifty or so years was to train Ceylonese youth to become Colonial Administrators. With that purpose in mind, they brought to the school the best of the English Public - School traditions.</p>
                <p>Through careful observations of the lives and history of the people of Kandy, the first missionaries realised that these were a people that firmly clung to their cultural identity.</p>
                <p>The missionaries " recognised the need to respect the world the school was part of, and despite their zealous faith, were compelled to offer the education that the people of the Central Highlands wanted. This gave Trinity a particular ' tone and ' shade ' that no other missionary school in Ceylon could claim. It is marked by a sensitivity to the vernacular. An ability to juggle social hierarchies and an unexpected tolerance of religious and ethnic differences are its hallmarks " wrote Ramya Chamila Jayasinghe in " Trinity " the book that marked the Centenary of the Colombo Old Boys Association.</p>
                <p>In essence, Kandy created Trinity in its own form. The " Colonial Project ", for some an offensive phrase, was to educate and train the sons of the local " Chieftains and to use a common Hindi phrase, make them " Pukka Sahibs " or gentlemen in the British mould. But the strong cultural strength of the capital of the Kandyan kingdom asserted itself.</p>
                <p>We track the age of Trinity College from January 17 , 1872 although the original school known as the Kandy Collegiate School, was started in 1857 by Rev. 1 Ireland Jones. On his departure, the school was closed in 1863. It was reopened in 1876 and renamed Trinity College Kandy. The author of the History of Trinity, Valesca Reiman quotes an annual report of the Christian Missionary Society to say that the school derives its name from the Trinity Church which was in the vicinity of the school.</p>
                <p>The founder Principal of Trinity College Kandy was Rev. Richard Collins. Some historians claim that the school got its name as Rev. Collins was an alumnus of Trinity College, Dublin.</p>
                <p>Following a six - year stint by Rev. Collins , the school faced some tumakyous years going through several Principals, who served relatively short terms.</p>
                <p>First, there was Rev. J G Garrett who led the school for five years. When he left due to ill - health , Rev. EN Hodges took over but was transferred by the Church after three short years . The Rev. EJ Perry who followed him was an experienced school administrator and brilliant scholar. However, rather unfortunately he died when he was accidentally shot by a student while on a trip to Bintenne . during the Easter Holiday. He served for just a year.</p>
                <p>In the next ten years, Trinity went through a transformation under Principal. Rev H.P.Napier - Clavering , M.A.of Trinity College , Cambridge , and a Master at Monkton Coombe School. He took over the school in 1890. The Centenary Number notes, " the great spirit of enthusiasm that had been stirred up by Mr. Perry and on this, he built a school the near equal of any in Ceylon. He first put it on a sound financial footing, added to the available accommodation, and constructed new classrooms. The school magazine came out , a Cricket Club was flourishing, the Cadet Corps was getting into its stride, and he helped form an Old Boys ' Association. This was the time when TCK got a sound foundation and strived to produce " all - rounders ", boys who were multi - dimensional and multi - skilled.</p>
                <p>" Mr. Napier - Clavering's successor was Rev. R W Ryde who was with Trinity for just two years. Thereafter, a succession of Principals helmed Trinity, with Mr. Napier - Clavering returning three times in an acting capacity.</p>
                <p><b>A.G. Fraser</b></p>
                <p>Then came the man, who was to be the biggest influencer in the history of the school, the Rev. A G. Fraser , who took over the Principalship in 1904 and held the post for 20 years , even though he was away for long periods.</p>

                    <p><b>Fraser Legacy</b></p>
                    <p>In 1910, six years after taking over as Principal, Alek Fraser was contemplating leaving Trinity to take up a post in the International Missionary Conference. In rejecting the move, the secretary of the CMS wrote to Fraser stating " We all agree that the position of Trinity College, Kandy, is tied up for the present in your I personality. The first three decades of TCK were marked by the faltering struggles of her founding Principals - many brilliant scholars among them to build an educational institution of national repute. If it took Fraser six years to turn things around by his sheer force of personality, in the course of twenty years, he would build an institutional legacy that would last a century.</p>
                    <p>He appreciated the transformative power of education on individuals and its foundational importance at societal scale. Perhaps more critically, he had a worldview that was nimble and sophisticated enough to understand that the elements of a sound education needed to be rooted in the student's cultural and historical context for them to be attu ed to the world around them, and well equipped to heed their calling as citizens. As a contemporary and admirer of Cecil Earle Tyndale - Biscoe, Fraser believed that schools had an active role to play in their community. Fraser was born two decades after the publication of Darwin's " The Origin of Species " and the subsequent split between Christian theology and science. Yet as a missionary educator, he crafted Trinity as a bastion of liberal values : free inquiry, scientific exploration, plurality of faith and inclusivity.</p>
                    <p>Alek Garden Fraser did have his failings too. He is often described as tough minded and uncompromising, and at times fiery. He is said to have been too quick to judge and draw false conclusions, and yet with enough humility to apologise to anyone he may have treated unfairly. And yet he had the good judgement and enough broadmindedness to recruit to his staff, teachers who would leave equally profound and long - lasting imprints on the character and traditions of the school. Whether it is the poetry of Senior that we admire or studies in I comparative religion that men like Saunders pioneered at school level. or the great traditions of social service that defined the Trinity identity and ethos which Norman Campbell instituted, it is worth remembering that these were all men that Fraser had hand - picked to join his staff. Rev. Gaster, to whose vision and legacy the college chapel bears witness, was not hand - pick by Fraser himself, but his path to Trinity would have been impossible, if not for Fraser's determination and fight.</p>
                    <p>As an administrator, Fraser had a clear vision which he often had to fight to realise. However, the long tenure that made possible his many great achievements, and ultimately his lasting legacy, owes as much to the trust he was able to establish even with those whom he fiercely disagreed , as much as to the force of his personality. Even though 1 many disagreed with him and some fell out ( and some even found him difficult to work with ) very few doubted his integrity or the fact that his fight was not personal but on matters of policy. In fact, he maintained great personal relations even with those whom he fiercely disagreed with.</p>
                    <p>1 There is no doubt however, that much of Trinity and the country has transformed beyond recognition in the century that separates the tenure of Alek Garden Fraser from the present. His legacy continues to inspire Trinitians, but not because we are able to recount what he did. nor even for knowing who he was, but for what he built. Even though the Chapel was constructed by his successors, its design and foundation were laid in his time and its form and architectural vision bear the imprint of Fraser's values and vision. It stands unambiguously as a place of Christian worship, both confident and authentic in the expression of its identity, like the school Fraser intended to build. And so, with Asgiriya - perhaps Trinity's greatest monument - Fraser has left encoded lessons that Trinitians will decipher and learn to apply in their time and place, for generations to come.</p>
                </div><br>
                <p>He had a powerful personality and inspired people he encountered to be loyal, and to be of service. Mr. Fraser was also good at choosing the right man for the right job. A great organiser, his powerful influence stayed with the College and for many, Trinity's name is synonymous with that of Fraser.</p>
                <p>He transformed the education system of the school.</p>
                <p>Trinity was designed to produce a complete individual, and Mr. Fraser sought to achieve that goal through many methods . The boys were taught to be alert in mind and body. He ensured they were well disciplined and conscious of their obligation to the society around them . The Social Service Union he started saw its members, the sons of the Kandyan elite visiting underserved communities around Mahaiyawa and cleaning and dressing the wounds of Sanitation workers.</p>
                <p>Students were encouraged to be selfless in their service, or in the least to do honest job in any profession they pursued.</p>
                <p>Indeed, it is this " Trinity Spirit ", instilled in students and staff all those long years ago that endures even today.</p>
                <p>As the former Vice Principal Hilary Abeyaratne, the author of the Centenary Number wrote " Above all, however, Mr.Fraser gave to Trinity a tone, an atmosphere, that is peculiarly its own . It was he who stressed and emphasized the need for a religious background to education ; it was he who realised , more than most contemporaries did , the need to synthesize the heritage of the East with what was best in the West."</p>
