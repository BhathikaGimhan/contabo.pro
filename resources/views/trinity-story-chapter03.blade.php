                <P><b>A Quiet Revolutionist - Lionel Fernando</b></P>
                <p>The last fifty years of Sri Lanka could be described as the most tumultuous period of the country, where the State restructured its policy on education on more than one occasion. Large - scale societal changes took place with the opening up of the economy and with it the emergence of a new social class. It was also a time that ripped the country apart; the more than thirty - year bloody civil conflict led by the youth in the North and East, and the second insurrection launched by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna.</p>
                <p>Yet, Trinity has been able to weather these many storms, trim her sails, adapt. and prepare herself for the future. This the school achieved through changes to the organisational structure and the curricula introduced by those who helmed the school, while retaining her spirit and ethos.</p>
                <p>Mr. Oorloff handed over the school to his successor, Mr. Lionel Fernando in October of 1968, just four years before the College turned a hundred. Mr.Fernando, who had no experience as an educator was the first non - Anglican to be appointed to the post, as he was a Methodist and inherited a school that was steadily and surely adapting to the rapidly changing Sri Lanka.</p>
                <p>A little over two years into Mr. Fernando's term, the 1971 insurrection engulfed the South of the country . Several members of the Staff who were volunteers in the Army were mobilised. However, there are no records of any Trinitians joining the insurgents. Despite the turbulence, Trinity was able to celebrate the Centenary with aplomb. The then Prime Minister Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike was the chief guest at the Centenary prize giving. Indeed, many of her extended family members and close aides, including her Deputy Minister of Defence, were products of Trinity College.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Principal Lionel Fernando's gra straddled the Centenary year. The celebrations raised the school's profile. and Trinity stepped into the new century with head held high.</p>
                <p>Mr. Fernando's was an era that saw College being introduced to concepts that may have been unthinkable a decade before.</p>
                <P>A deeply spiritual man, and a firm Christian, he respected all other religions. He believed that the school must retain its identity as a leading Christian institution but advocated for the recognition of the rights of other religions.</P>
                <P> Prof. Malik Ranasinghe, who held the post of President of the Buddhist Students Movement ( BSM ), at the time recalls asking Mr. Fernando permission to hold an overnight Pirith chanting ceremony in the College Hall in February 1976, Mr. Fernando's first reaction is memorable , says Prof Ranasinghe . He asked me whether I was trying to get him sacked from Trinity."</P>
                <P>Permission was granted for the Buddhist ceremony while Muslims and Hindus too received the go - ahead to hold their ceremonies in the school. Writes Mr. Esperance Ratwatte in " Glimpses of the Past, " " That which followed was amazing - perfect religious harmony. Nobody predicted that Christians , Muslims , and Hindus would participate in the almsgiving of the Buddhists and at the end of it , share a meal together . That was the way in those days . " </P>
                <P>The annual Carol Service soon became an event that drew the participation of students of all faiths, with many actively contributing to its choreography and design. The choir itself included non - Christians, with several playing lead roles.</P>
                <P> Closer relationships were formed with, in particular with the Prelates of the nearby Asgiriya Chapter. When the ownership of the Asgiriya grounds was contested, the temple held firm that although Trinity was a Christian school it has rightful ownership of the grounds.</P>
                <P>Mr.Fernando led by example; during the racial riots of 1977, when many of Kandy's Tamil community came under attack and were destitute, he gave them refuge on the school's campus.</P>
                <P>Vice Principal Hilary Abeyaratne had been a leading contender for the post of Principal. Yet, though it was Mr. Fernando who was appointed Principal, the two, both alumni of the school, worked well together to further develop the curricula and the infrastructure of the school.</P>
                <P>Trinity got a swimming pool during this time. Mr.Fernando also took a personal interest in the development of the Kandyan Drum and Dance Troupe, which won both national and international honours for the first time, during his era.</P>

            <div class="contant container">
                <P>During the twenty years after the turn of the century, Trinity passed through five Principals.</P>
                <P>The civil war was at its height and continued to cast a shadow over the general well - being of the country and by extension all schools including Trinity.</P>
                <P>The student body remained large, while the number of boarders dropped. Yet, it was during this period that Trinity's academic performance showed improvement, with more students entering university. The school also had some notable successes in the sporting arena.</P>
                <P><b>Laid the Framework to Improve Academics - Professor WR Breckenridge.</b></P>
                <P>With the resignation of Lt. Colonel Leonard de Alwis as the 15th Principal, another Trinity alumnus with strong connections to the school took over. Prof. Warren R Breckenridge hailed from a long line of Trinitians who had served the school with distinction for nearly a century. His brothers and his father, the legendary R R Breckenridge, an English teacher, were all past students.</P>
                <P>On his appointment as Principal, Prof.WR ' as he was known, resigned his post at Professor of Zoology at the University of Peradeniya, where he had served for forty years to don the Trinity mantle. An all - rounder, excelling in the Arts, academics, and sports at school, Prof.Breckenridge held an equally distinguished record overseas.</P>
                <P>Prof.Breckenridge's time is seen by many long - term observers as a defining period. Seeking to usher Trinity into the modern era, he set about improving the school's academic record and admitting sons of educated professionals. The groundwork he laid to improve the school's academic reputation, continues to yield results even in the present day, with more students gaining university entrance to the fields of Engineering, Information Technology, and Science disciplines.</P>
                <P>Indeed, Trinity continues to reap what Breck ' sowed, even in her 150th year. It was during his time that the laboratories used by Advanced Level students and the classrooms received a makeover. He believed that Advanced Level students must set the bar for the entire student body, observes Simon Senaratne, another Trinity alumnus.</P>
                <p>He introduced instruction in English for the Advanced Level classes and also began an English Medium stream at Grade 6. Many societies and associations including the TCLA, the Historical and Geographical Societies, and the Drama Society were rejuvenated during his tenure.</p>
                <p>The Middle School underwent restructuring, and like the Upper and Junior Schools, got its own headmaster. An Advisory Committee made up of past students was set up to plan, raise funds and manage the physical improvement of the school. As well, with an eye on improving teaching methods, the staff was sent for workshops and refresher courses. Professor Breckenridge was also uncompromising when it involved disciplinary issues and upholding Trinity values, the traditions he had been schooled in. In one instance he canceled the cricket season over a disciplinary matter and had also expelled some students for impersonation at a public exam.</p>
                <p>He had also been very particular about the quality of students admitted to the school. Amongst changes he introduced was also assigning students to the senior dorm of Alison. Napier, and Ryde, according to age and class grade.</p>
                <p>Professor Breckenridge who left his post in 2003 passed away in 2009.</p>
